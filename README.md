# Dev_JDBC
This repository demonstrates core concepts and implementations of Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), focusing on establishing secure and efficient connections between Java applications and relational databases like MySQL. The project includes examples of all major CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and offers a practical guide to handling database transactions in Java.

Key Features:
#Database Connections: Establishes robust connections with MySQL databases using JDBC.  
#CRUD Operations: Provides implementations of core operations like inserting, retrieving, updating, and deleting records in a relational database.  
#Prepared Statements: Uses PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection and enhance query performance.  
#Transaction Management: Demonstrates handling transactions to ensure data consistency and integrity.  
#Exception Handling: Implements robust error and exception handling mechanisms for database operations.                                                                                      
#Project Use Case: Simulated use case for a Hospital Management System, showcasing patient record management using JDBC.
#Technologies Used:
*Java SE
*JDBC
*MySQL
*Maven (Optional, if included)
T*his repository is ideal for learning and understanding the integration of Java applications with relational databases through JDBC.
